A game in which you need to choose words in such a way that the endings match.

## Rules

In the game you need to write a word that begins with a certain letter and ends with the specified ending.
> Only nouns are accepted.

- If a word does not exist in the dictionary, it is not counted.
- If a word begins with the specified letter, but does not end with the desired ending, then the beginning changes.
Thus, it is necessary to make a sequence of words and get to the desired ending.
- If you do not have time to compose a word in the specified time, then the game will be lost.
- The entered words cannot be re-entered.

## Control

The word is entered from the keyboard.

To delete a character, press the **Backspace** key.

To enter a word, press **Enter**.
